          I'm a passionate developer with expertise in front-end, back-end
          technologies, and cybersecurity, creating responsive, secure, and
          user-centric web applications.

            I'm a dedicated and versatile developer with a strong foundation in
            both frontend and backend technologies, as well as hands-on
            experience in cybersecurity. I specialize in building responsive and
            user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
            Tailwind CSS, while also developing robust backend systems with
            Node.js, MongoDB, and Django. Alongside web development, I have a
            solid understanding of cybersecurity principles, including API
            security (OWASP API Top 10), network scanning, vulnerability
            assessment, and privilege escalation. With tools like Nmap, Burp
            Suite, and Metasploit, I focus on identifying and mitigating
            security threats through secure coding practices. I'm also
            experienced with version control using Git and backend testing
            frameworks such as JUnit 5 and Mockito. In addition, Iâ€™ve worked
            with cloud tools like the AWS SDK and used build tools like Maven,
            enabling me to deploy scalable and maintainable applications. I
            thrive on solving complex problems, continuously learning, and
            contributing to secure, high-quality software solutions.
